# 🌿 AgroVision - Crop Pest & Disease Classification

AgroVision is a data-driven image classification system that leverages machine learning/ deep learning to diagnose crop pests and diseases from images. The project focuses on data understanding, model development, and performance evaluation. The final output includes a trained model, evaluation metrics, and documented insights that can be used to diagnose crop health for crops local to Ghana, as well as serve as a foundation for future models specific to other regions of the globe.

### Dataset:

### Development Environment:

This project was primarily developed and executed using Google Colab with Google Drive mounted for dataset storage and pipeline execution.

### Pipeline stages:

```
Raw Images → Ingest → Validate → Preprocess → Split → Train → Evaluate → Deploy
```

### Part 1 - Training on Google Colab

The entire training pipeline runs on Google Colab using the dataset stored on Google Drive.

#### Step 1 - Open Google Colab

Create New notebook

#### Step 2 - Enable GPU

```
Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU (T4) → Save
```

#### Step 3 - Mount Google Drive
``` bash
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

#### Step 4 - Install dependencies
``` bash
!pip install timm albumentations imagehash tqdm pandas opencv-python-headless -q
```

#### Step 5 — Upload project to Colab
Either upload manually via the Files panel (left sidebar in Colab), or clone from GitHub:

``` bash 
!git clone https://github.com/yourname/agrovision.git
%cd agrovision
```

#### Step 6 — Install deployment dependencies 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 7 — Run the full pipeline 

```bash
!python pipeline.py
```
This runs all 6 stages in order automatically. All outputs are saved back to Google Drive.

#### Step 8 - If Colab disconnects mid-training
Colab free tier disconnects after ~90 min of inactivity. Just re-run — completed stages are automatically skipped thanks to checkpoint flags in logs/:

```bash
# Resume from a specific stage (skips everything before it)
!python pipeline.py train
!python pipeline.py split
```

#### Step 9 — Pipeline stages reference

| Stage | File | What it does | Output |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `stage_01_ingest.py` | Scans Drive dataset folder | `manifest.csv` |
| 2 | `stage_02_validate.py` | Removes corrupt / duplicate / low-res images | `manifest_clean.csv` |
| 3 | `stage_03_preprocess.py` | Resizes all images to 224×224 RGB | `output/processed/` |
| 4 | `stage_04_split.py` | Encodes labels, 70/15/15 stratified split | `splits/train/val/test.csv` |
| 5 | `stage_05_train.py` | Trains EfficientNet-B3, saves best model | `checkpoints/best.pth` |
| 6 | `stage_06_evaluate.py` | Classification report on unseen test set | `evaluation_report.txt` |



### Part 2 — Deployment on Local
After training on Colab, run the web app locally in VS Code. localhost:8000 works directly on your machine.

#### Step 1 — Get the project folder to your local machine

Google Drive Desktop App

1. Install Google Drive for Desktop
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Drive appears as G:\My Drive\ in Windows File Explorer
4. Copy agrovision/ from G:\My Drive\agrovision to your local Projects folder:

```bash
C:\path\to\Projects\agrovision
```

#### Step 2 — Open project in VS Code/any local IDE

```bash
cd C:\path\to\Projects\agrovision
code .
```

#### Step 3 — Create virtual environment
Open the VS Code terminal and run:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### Step 4 — Activate virtual environment

**Windows:**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see (venv) appear in your terminal prompt.

#### Step 5 — Install deployment dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements_deploy.txt
```
